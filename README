Emacs-Rep

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

Additionally, you need to make sure that this file has
been added to a location in your emacs load-path:

        elisp/rep.el

And as explained at the top of that file:

   Add the following into your ~/.emacs (or equivalent):
     (require 'rep)
