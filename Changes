Revision history for Emacs-Rep

        First version.
        Limitation: all of perl's substitutions syntax is
        not supported, in particular substitutions with embedded
        semicolons may behave oddly.

0.02    Sun Jun  6 17:36:22 2010
        Using a PPI-based solution now.  The full range of perl's
        substitution syntax is now supported.
        Have support for multi-line substitutions.
        Window management is more careful (no crashes
        from the current window being too small).
        User set-up is more flexible (easy to use an alternative key prefix).

0.03    Fri Jun 11 04:31:04 2010
        Implemented an entirely new system of managing change
        metadata, which now supports individual undos of
        cascading, overlapping substitution changes.
        The modified buffer is now made read-only until changes
        are accepted.
        rep-standard-setup is more flexible.
