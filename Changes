        First version.
        Limitation: all of perl's substitutions syntax is
        not supported, in particular substitutions with embedded
        semicolons may behave oddly.

0.02    Tue Jun  1 00:57:44 2010
        Using a PPI-based solution now.  The full range of perl's
        substitution syntax is now supported (including the insane
        one).
