        First version.
        Limitation: all of perl's substitutions syntax is
        not supported, in particular substitutions with embedded
        semicolons may behave oddly.

        Using a PPI-based solution now.  The full range of perl's
        substitution syntax is now supported.
        Have support for multi-line substitutions.
        Window management is more careful (no crashes
        from the current window being too small).
        User set-up is more flexible (easy to use an alternative key prefix).
