Revision history for Emacs-Rep

0.01    Sun May 30 12:23:55 2010
        First version.
        Limitation: all of perl's substitutions syntax is
        not supported, in particular substitutions with embedded
        semicolons may behave oddly.

0.02    Sun Jun  6 17:36:22 2010
        Using a PPI-based solution now.  The full range of perl's
        substitution syntax is now supported.
        Have support for multi-line substitutions.
        Window management is more careful (no crashes
        from the current window being too small).
        User set-up is more flexible (easy to use an alternative key prefix).

0.03    Fri Jun 11 04:31:04 2010
        Implemented an entirely new system of managing change
        metadata, which now supports an indefinite series of
        individual undos of cascading, overlapping substitution
        changes.
        The modified buffer is now made read-only until changes
        are accepted.
        User set-up with rep-standard-setup is still more flexible.

0.04    Sat Jun 12 22:34:28 2010

        Cleaner handling of zero-width end results (i.e.  when a
        s///g is used to delete a string entirely, now you can
        still tab to that location and undo the deletion).
        Also made modifications to backtab behavior to work better
        with these "zero width" regions.

0.05    Tue Jun 15 11:44:04 2010

        Cleaner implementation of tab/backtab functions in
        rep-modififed-mode:
        These:
          rep-modified-skip-to-next-change and rep-modified-skip-to-prev-change
        now use the primitives:
           rep-at-start-of-changed-region
           rep-at-end-of-changed-region
        which are built on top of the (successful) experiment:
           rep-rising-or-falling-edge
