;;; Commentary:

;; "Rep" is a system for doing global finds and replaces throughout
;; a file with a set of perl substitution commands (that is, "s///g").

;; This elisp code is the interactive front-end, which uses perl
;; code as a back-end to execute the changes, so you get to use
;; actual perl5 regexps, and you have (almost) all of the features
;; of perl substitutions.

;; The interactive features of rep.el include the ability to
;; reject individual changes, or to revert all of the changes and
;; start over.

;; INSTALLATION and SET-UP

;; If it isn't there already, put this file (rep.el) somewhere in
;; your emacs load-path.

;; If possible, you should just install the Emacs-Rep CPAN
;; package (and see the README file inside that package).

;; Otherwise, you will also need to make sure the script "rep.pl"
;; to be located somewhere in your system PATH, and the Emacs::Rep
;; perl module (i.e. the file Emacs/Rep.pm) is installed somewhere
;; that rep.pl can find it (e.g. a location in your PERL5LIB
;; environment variable).

;; Just add the following into your ~/.emacs (or equivalent):
;;   (require 'rep)
;;   (rep-standard-setup)

;; For setup customization alternatives to the "rep-standard-setup",
;; see SET-UP CUSTOMIZATION below.

;; USAGE

;; When editing a file you'd like to modify interactively
;; using perl substitution commands (usually of the from
;; s///g;), you can use "C-c.S" to open a small window suitable
;; for entering a series of substitution commands. When you're
;; ready, "C-c.R" will run these substitutions on the other
;; window.

;; The usual font-lock syntax coloring will be temporarily
;; shut-off, so that changed strings can be indicated with
;; colors that correspond to the particular s///g command that
;; made the change.

;; In the buffer for the modified file a "rep-modified-mode" minor
;; mode has been switched on with keybindings to do various useful
;; tasks as you evaluate the changes made by your substitutions.

;;    TAB       rep-modified-skip-to-next-change
;;              You can easily skip to the next change with the tab key.

;;    "C-c.w"   rep-modified-what-was-changed-here-verbose
;;              Tells you want the changed string at the cursor
;;              was before it was modified.

;;    "C-c.u"   rep-modified-undo-change-here
;;              Does an undo of an individual change, changing it back
;;              to the string indicated with "C-c.w".
;;              Note: there's no relation between this and the usual emacs
;;              undo mechanism, they operate independantly.

;;    "C-c.R"   rep-modified-revert-all-changes
;;              All of the changes from a run of substitutions
;;              can be reverted all at once, using this command.
;;              If there have been multiple substitutions runs
;;              on the same file-buffer, repeated uses of this
;;              command will continue reverting the previous run.

;;     "C-c.A"  rep-modified-accept-changes
;;              When you're convinced that the substitutions run did
;;              what you wanted, you can use this to accept the changes
;;              and get your normal syntax coloring back.

;;  Note that the *.rep files you create with C-c.S can be run again
;;  on other files.  This should simplify making similar changes to
;;  a large number of files (though at present there are no recursive
;;  descent features provided by this library).

;;  Additionally, there's the command:

;;    "C-c.x"   rep-modified-examine-properties-at-point
;;              This is more informative than C-c.w, but less neat.


;; SET-UP CUSTOMIZATION

;; The easy way to get the standard (i.e. documented) behavior
;; is just to use (rep-standard-setup)

;; If you'd like different behavior, here are some hints:

;; You can choose a different standard key prefix (other than the
;; default "Control-c .") easily enough like so:

;;   (rep-standard-setup "\C-c|")  ;; "Control-c vertical-bar"

;; The standard set-up is roughly equivalent to the following
;; (so you can start with this and edit it as you like):

;;   (global-set-key "C-c.S" 'rep-open-substitutions)
;;   (add-to-list
;;    'auto-mode-alist
;;    '("\\.\\(rep\\)\\'" . rep-substitutions-mode))
;;   (define-key rep-substitutions-mode-map "\C-c.R"
;;     'rep-substitutions-apply-to-other-window)
;;   (rep-define-rep-modified-mode-keybindings "\C-c.")

;; And that last line can be expanded still further, into
;; something like:

;;     (add-hook 'rep-modified-mode-hook
;;           '(lambda ()
;;              (local-set-key "%sw"  'rep-modified-what-was-changed-here-verbose)
;;              (local-set-key "%sx"  'rep-modified-examine-properties-at-point)
;;              (local-set-key "%su"  'rep-modified-undo-change-here)
;;              (local-set-key "%sR"  'rep-modified-revert-all-changes)
;;              (local-set-key "%sA"  'rep-modified-accept-changes)
;;              (local-set-key [tab]  'rep-modified-skip-to-next-change)
;;              (local-set-key [backtab]  'rep-modified-skip-to-prev-change)
;;              ))
